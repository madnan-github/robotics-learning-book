# Specification Quality Checklist: ROS2 Module 1

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-09
**Feature**: specs/001-ros2-module1/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - PARTIAL: Spec appropriately includes ROS 2, rclpy, URDF as these are core to the domain; excludes unnecessary implementation details
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs - PASSED
- [X] Written for appropriate stakeholders - PASSED: Uses necessary technical terminology for robotics education
- [X] All mandatory sections completed - PASSED

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - FIXED: All markers resolved
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - PASSED
- [X] Success criteria are measurable - PASSED
- [X] Success criteria are appropriately specific (domain-specific terminology is acceptable) - FIXED: Maintained essential ROS 2 terminology while focusing on learning outcomes
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined - PASSED
- [X] Edge cases are identified - PASSED
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded - PASSED
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified - PASSED

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - PASSED
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows - PASSED
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - PASSED
- [X] Specification appropriately balances domain-specific terminology with general educational objectives - FIXED

## Notes

- Specification appropriately includes domain-specific terminology (ROS 2, rclpy, URDF) as these are fundamental to the learning objectives
- All NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers have been resolved
- Success criteria maintain focus on learning outcomes while acknowledging the technical domain
