# Robotic Learning Book

Welcome to the comprehensive robotics learning curriculum! This book takes you from foundational ROS 2 concepts through advanced AI integration, preparing you for cutting-edge robotics development.

## About This Book

This robotics learning book is structured as a progressive curriculum that builds from basic concepts to advanced applications. Each module builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive understanding of modern robotics systems.

## Learning Path

The curriculum is organized into four progressive modules:

### [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/robotic-learning-book/docs/module1/intro)
- Master ROS 2 fundamentals: nodes, topics, services
- Learn rclpy Python API for robot control
- Understand URDF robot descriptions
- Build the foundation for all subsequent modules

### [Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)](/robotic-learning-book/docs/module2/intro)
- Physics simulation with Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering with Unity
- Sensor simulation pipeline (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)
- Connect simulation to ROS 2 systems

### [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)](/robotic-learning-book/docs/module3/intro)
- Photorealistic simulation with Isaac Sim
- GPU-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS
- Visual SLAM implementation
- Navigation stack adaptation for bipedal robots

### [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/robotic-learning-book/docs/module4/intro)
- Voice command processing with Whisper
- LLM-based cognitive planning
- End-to-end pipeline integration
- Capstone project preparation

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Some familiarity with robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Technical Requirements

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- For Module 3: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- For Module 4: Access to LLM APIs or local models
- Development environment for Python and C++

## Getting Started

Begin with [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/robotic-learning-book/docs/module1/intro) to establish your foundational knowledge, then progress through each module in sequence to build comprehensive robotics expertise.

## About the Author

This curriculum was designed to bridge the gap between theoretical robotics concepts and practical implementation, emphasizing hands-on learning with real-world applications.
