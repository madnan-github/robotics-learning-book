# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Robotic Learning Book! In this module, we'll explore the concept of Digital Twins in robotics, focusing on physics simulation with Gazebo and high-fidelity rendering with Unity. This dual-simulator approach provides complementary capabilities for robotics development.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Launch and configure humanoid robot simulations in Gazebo
- Add objects and configure physics parameters in simulation environments
- Implement simulated sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) that publish to ROS 2 topics
- Visualize simulated sensor data in RViz2
- Understand the trade-offs between simulation realism and computational efficiency
- Articulate Unity's role for high-fidelity rendering and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios
- Connect Unity to ROS 2 via the ROS-TCP-connector
- Describe the complete simulation-to-AI pipeline for Digital Twin methodology

## The Digital Twin Concept

A Digital Twin in robotics is a virtual representation of a physical robot system that enables safe, efficient testing and development. The twin allows us to:

- Test algorithms without risk to physical hardware
- Generate synthetic data for AI training
- Validate behaviors before deployment
- Debug complex interactions in a controlled environment

In this module, we'll use two complementary simulation tools:
- **Gazebo**: Physics-focused simulation for accurate robot dynamics
- **Unity**: Visual fidelity-focused for high-quality rendering and HRI

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have completed:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

You should be comfortable with:
- Basic ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services)
- Working with rclpy in Python
- Understanding URDF robot descriptions
