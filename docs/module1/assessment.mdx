## Assessment Overview

This assessment evaluates your understanding of the core concepts covered in this module. It includes multiple-choice questions, a diagram labeling exercise, and a hands-on coding task to apply your knowledge.

## Part 1: Multiple Choice Questions

## Part 2: Diagram Labeling Exercise

Below is a diagram representing the publish-subscribe communication pattern in ROS 2:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Publisher Node] -->|Publishes to| B(Topic)
    C[Subscriber Node 1] -->|Subscribes from| B
    D[Subscriber Node 2] -->|Subscribes from| B
    E[Subscriber Node 3] -->|Subscribes from| B

    style A fill:#4CAF50
    style B fill:#2196F3
    style C fill:#FF9800
    style D fill:#FF9800
    style E fill:#FF9800
```

Label the following components:
1. What component represents the communication channel? ___________
2. What type of nodes send data to the communication channel? ___________
3. What type of nodes receive data from the communication channel? ___________

## Part 3: Hands-On Coding Task

### Task: Fix and Complete the Provided ROS 2 Node

The following code has several issues. Your task is to identify and fix them, then enhance the node with additional functionality.

**Original code (with issues):**

```python
# broken_node.py
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class BrokenNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('broken_node')
        # ISSUE 1: Incorrect topic name format
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'bad_topic_name', 10)

        # ISSUE 2: Timer period is too fast
        timer_period = 0.001  # seconds - too fast!
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)

        # ISSUE 3: Missing counter initialization
        # self.i = 0  # This line is commented out - bug!

    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        # ISSUE 4: Not using the counter
        msg.data = 'Hello World!'  # Should include counter value
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        # ISSUE 5: Not logging the published message
        # Missing logging statement

def main():
    rclpy.init()
    node = BrokenNode()
    # ISSUE 6: Missing spin loop
    # The node needs to be spun to process callbacks
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Your Task:
1. Identify the 6 issues in the code above
2. Provide a corrected and enhanced version of the code
3. Add a subscriber component that listens to a "response" topic
4. Make sure the code follows the type hinting and docstring standards required by the project constitution

### Corrected Code:

```python
# fixed_node.py
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String
from typing import Any


class FixedNode(Node):
    """
    A fixed and enhanced ROS 2 node that demonstrates proper publisher/subscriber patterns.

    This node publishes messages to a topic and subscribes to response messages,
    demonstrating the fundamental communication patterns in ROS 2.
    """

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize the fixed node with proper publishers and subscribers."""
        super().__init__('fixed_node')

        # Create a publisher for sending messages
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'chatter', 10)

        # Create a subscription for receiving responses
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            String,
            'response',
            self.response_callback,
            10)

        # Make sure the subscription is properly set up
        self.subscription  # prevent unused variable warning

        # Set a reasonable timer period (0.5 seconds)
        timer_period = 0.5  # seconds
        self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.timer_callback)

        # Initialize counter
        self.i = 0

        # Log that the node has started
        self.get_logger().info('Fixed node initialized')

    def timer_callback(self) -> None:
        """Callback function that runs when the timer ticks."""
        msg = String()
        # Include counter value in message
        msg.data = f'Hello World: {self.i}'

        # Publish the message
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)

        # Log the published message
        self.get_logger().info(f'Publishing: "{msg.data}"')

        # Increment the counter
        self.i += 1

    def response_callback(self, msg: String) -> None:
        """
        Callback function that runs when a response message is received.

        Args:
            msg: The received response message
        """
        self.get_logger().info(f'Received response: {msg.data}')


def main(args: Any = None) -> None:
    """
    Main function to run the fixed node.

    Args:
        args: Arguments to pass to rclpy.init()
    """
    # Initialize rclpy
    rclpy.init(args=args)

    # Create the fixed node
    fixed_node = FixedNode()

    # Run the node until interrupted
    try:
        rclpy.spin(fixed_node)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        # Clean up
        fixed_node.destroy_node()
        rclpy.shutdown()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Part 4: URDF Interpretation Task

Consider the following URDF snippet:

```xml
<link name="arm_link">
  <visual>
    <geometry>
      <cylinder length="0.4" radius="0.05"/>
    </geometry>
    <material name="blue">
      <color rgba="0 0 1 1"/>
    </material>
  </visual>
  <collision>
    <geometry>
      <cylinder length="0.4" radius="0.05"/>
    </geometry>
  </collision>
  <inertial>
    <mass value="2"/>
    <inertia ixx="0.02" ixy="0" ixz="0" iyy="0.02" iyz="0" izz="0.005"/>
  </inertial>
</link>

<joint name="shoulder_joint" type="revolute">
  <parent link="torso"/>
  <child link="arm_link"/>
  <origin xyz="0.2 0.15 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
  <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
  <limit lower="-1.57" upper="1.57" effort="50" velocity="1"/>
</joint>
```

Answer the following questions:

1. What is the name of the link defined in this snippet?
2. What geometric shape represents the visual and collision properties of this link?
3. What is the mass of this link?
4. What type of joint connects the "torso" link to the "arm_link"?
5. What is the range of motion (lower and upper limits) for this joint?
