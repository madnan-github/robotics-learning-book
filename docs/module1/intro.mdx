# Introduction to ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
1. Explain the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including Nodes, Topics, and Services
2. Diagram and explain the data flow between ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
3. Write a functional Python script that publishes sensor data and subscribes to control commands
4. Interpret a basic URDF file for a humanoid robot, identifying key links, joints, and sensors

## Overview

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Learning Platform. This module will introduce you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the "nervous system" for robots, enabling communication between software agents and physical (or simulated) hardware components.

ROS 2 is a middleware framework that provides services such as hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. Think of it as the communication infrastructure that allows different parts of a robot to work together seamlessly.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, we'll cover:
- The core concepts of ROS 2: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- How to create a simple Python agent that communicates with ROS 2
- Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for robot modeling
- Practical exercises to reinforce your understanding

Let's begin by exploring the foundational concepts that make up the ROS 2 ecosystem.
