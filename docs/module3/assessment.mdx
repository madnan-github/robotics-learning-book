# Module 3 Assessment

This assessment tests your understanding of NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, GPU-accelerated perception, and humanoid navigation.

## Quiz Questions

1. What are the key differences between Isaac Sim and traditional simulation tools like Gazebo?
2. How does Isaac ROS leverage GPU acceleration for perception tasks?
3. What are the main challenges in adapting Nav2 for bipedal humanoid robots?
4. Explain the synthetic data generation → training → deployment workflow.

## Practical Exercise

**Task**: Implement a Visual SLAM system using Isaac ROS that:
